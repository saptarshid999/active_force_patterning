# Segregation, Finite Time Elastic Singularities and Coarsening in Renewable Active Materials
This contains codes for the manuscript 'Segregation, Finite Time Elastic Singularities and Coarsening in Renewable Active Materials'


The codes are written in Python using the pseudo-spectral solver Dedalus. Snapshots (containing the values of the variables and quantities of interest) are saved in HDF5 files. The file 'one_species.py' is for a single stresslet on an elastomer. This code can be run for the parameter regimes (either the segregation or the wave regime) mentioned in the Supplementary Material. The file 'two_species.py' is for two stresslets on an elastomer. Movie S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8, S9 and S10 are generated using data generated from these codes.

The file analysis.ipynb contains code to extract data generated by 'two_species.py'. It can be run in any interactive notebook like Jupyter notebook or Visual Studio Code.
